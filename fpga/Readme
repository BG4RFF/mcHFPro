This fpga project is a fork from the Ettus Research USRP1 open source distribution. 
It is ported on smaller 144 LQFP part. Conditional compiling is used, 
so only single channel, RX path is used. All extra pin connections for TX 
and daughterboards are commented out.

To compile:

1. Install Quartus 2, v 11.00 Web Edition
2. Go to toplevel/usrp_std
3. Double click on usrp_std.qpf
4. Use Cntr-L to rebuild
